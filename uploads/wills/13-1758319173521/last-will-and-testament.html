      <p><strong>B. Bond & Court Supervision —</strong> No bond or other security shall be required of my Executor (or Digital Executor) in any jurisdiction.

      <p><strong>G.

      <h2>Article III: Gifts at Death (Tangible Personal Property)</h2>
      <p>“Tangible Personal Property” includes household goods, furnishings, pictures, books, clothing, jewelry, and other tangible items of similar nature. Except as provided elsewhere in this Will or in a signed memorandum regarding tangible personal property (including items associated with a gift of real property, if applicable), my Executor shall distribute the balance of my Tangible Personal Property to the beneficiaries listed in Article IV, with particular items to be allocated as they may agree, or, if they cannot agree, as my Executor determines in the Executor’s discretion. The cost of packing and shipping shall be an administration expense.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h2>Article IV: Gift of Residue</h2>
      <p><strong>Primary distributions:</strong> Manisha Sharma (person) – 100%.</p>
      
      
      <p>If any disposition in this Article fails, the related share shall be added pro rata to the remaining effective dispositions in this Article.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h2>Article V: Takers of Last Resort</h2>
      <p>If all other dispositions in this Will fail, the residue of my estate shall be distributed to my Heirs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
      <h2>Article VI: General Provisions</h2>
      <p><strong>A. Severability —</strong> If any provision of this Will is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
      <p><strong>B. Survivorship —</strong> A beneficiary shall be deemed to have survived me only if living on the thirtieth (30th) day after my death; a person legally prohibited from inheriting shall be treated as having failed to survive me.</p>
      <p><strong>C. Payment of Taxes —</strong> All estate, inheritance, or similar taxes (including interest and penalties) arising in connection with my death with respect to any property included in my gross estate shall be paid from the residue of my estate without apportionment, except that no such taxes shall be charged against property qualifying for the marital or charitable deduction unless necessary due to insufficiency of other assets.</p>
      <p><strong>D. HIPAA Release —</strong> My Executor (including any successor) shall be treated as my “personal representative” under HIPAA and its regulations and may receive and disclose my protected health information as necessary.</p>
      <p><strong>E. Payment of Expenses —</strong> All funeral and administration expenses shall be paid from the residue of my estate; if insufficient, the excess shall be paid pro rata from assets passing by reason of my death.</p>
      <p><strong>F. Savings Clause —</strong> Words of one gender include the other, and the singular includes the plural and vice versa, as context requires.</p>
      <p><strong>G. Terminology —</strong> “Descendants” means lineal blood descendants of any degree and includes adopted children and their descendants, except a person adopted after age 18 and that person’s descendants are excluded. “Heirs” means those who would inherit separate personal property from me under the intestacy statutes of my domiciliary state if I died unmarried and intestate at such time. “Per stirpes” distributions follow representation by branch starting at the nearest generation with survivors.</p>
      <p><strong>H. Discretion —</strong> Any discretion granted to my Executor or Digital Executor is intended to be sole, absolute, and unfettered.</p>
      <p><strong>I. Spendthrift Provisions —</strong> Prior to actual receipt, no interest distributable under this Will shall be subject to anticipation or assignment by any beneficiary or to claims of creditors.</p>
      <p><strong>J. Beneficiary Receiving Public Benefits —</strong> If a beneficiary is receiving or may be eligible for means‑tested government benefits, my Executor may withhold outright distribution and instead hold such beneficiary’s share in a separate trust for that beneficiary’s supplemental needs, to be used to supplement (not supplant) government benefits; the Trustee’s discretion shall be final, and the trust shall include customary restrictions (no withdrawal right, no general power of appointment) and terminate as provided therein.</p>
