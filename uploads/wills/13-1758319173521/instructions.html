    <h1>Instructions for Will 1 of 3</h1>
    <p>You’re almost done! Follow these instructions to make your will legally valid.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read your will carefully and make sure you understand everything. If you have questions, speak with a lawyer.</li>
      <li>Find two witnesses who are at least 18 and mentally competent. They and their spouses should not receive gifts in your will.</li>
      <li>You and your witnesses must sign and date your will in the same session.</li>
      <li>While in the presence of your witnesses, state: “This is my Last Will and Testament that I am signing, and it represents my wishes.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Instructions for Will 2 of 3</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>You may use the Personal Property Memorandum for tangible items (e.g., jewelry, art, electronics) not specifically gifted in your will. Sign and date it if you use it.</li>
      <li>If you wish to make your will self‑proving, meet with a notary together with your two witnesses to complete the notarial acknowledgment.</li>
      <li>Store your original, signed will in a safe, accessible place (e.g., a fire‑resistant box). Do not remove staples or tear pages.</li>
      <li>Let your executor know where to find the original and ensure they can access it.</li>
    </ul>

  <div>
    <h1>Instructions for Will 3 of 3</h1>
    <p class="small">You may distribute copies of your signed will for reference, but your original must be located after your death for probate. Update your will after major life changes (marriage, birth, divorce, relocation). This material is not legal advice.</p>
