# **A Technical Manual for a Strategic Roth Conversion Calculator: Algorithm and Full-Stack Implementation**

## **Part I: The Strategic Foundation of Roth Conversions in the Post-OBBBA Era**

The decision to execute a Roth conversion—transferring assets from a tax-deferred retirement account like a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a tax-free Roth IRA—is one of the most consequential strategic choices in modern financial planning. It requires a sophisticated analysis that extends far beyond a simple comparison of current versus presumed future tax rates. This manual provides a comprehensive framework for developing a financial planning tool capable of performing this analysis with the requisite precision. It details the underlying tax law, presents a robust calculation algorithm, and delivers a complete, production-ready software implementation.

The analysis and algorithms herein are based on the federal tax code for the 2025 tax year, incorporating the significant and permanent changes enacted by the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA).1 This legislation has eliminated the scheduled 2026 sunset of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), making its tax rate structure permanent while introducing a host of new deductions, credits, and phase-outs that fundamentally alter the conversion calculation.2

### **The Modern Case for Tax Diversification**

At its core, a Roth conversion is a strategy for achieving tax diversification in retirement. A well-balanced portfolio should not only be diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, alternatives) but also across tax treatments. Retirees draw income from three primary "buckets":

1. **Tax-Deferred:** Traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred. All withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.  
2. **Taxable:** Brokerage accounts, savings accounts. There is no upfront tax benefit. Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed as they are realized.  
3. **Tax-Free:** Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Qualified withdrawals of both contributions and earnings are entirely free from federal income tax.4

The primary objective of a Roth conversion is to systematically move assets from the tax-deferred bucket to the tax-free bucket. This provides retirees with unparalleled flexibility to manage their taxable income year-to-year. By choosing which bucket to draw from, they can exert significant control over their marginal tax rate, the taxation of their Social Security benefits, and their exposure to income-based surcharges like Medicare IRMAA.6

The passage of OBBBA has created a unique planning environment. By making the TCJA's individual income tax rates of 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37% permanent, the law provides a window of relative certainty.2 However, this permanence is a political construct, not an immutable guarantee. Future legislative action could alter these rates, potentially reverting them to higher pre-TCJA levels or introducing new surcharges.8 This underlying uncertainty transforms the Roth conversion decision from a simple mathematical projection into a powerful risk management strategy. Paying a known tax rate today on a conversion acts as a hedge against the risk of facing unknown and potentially much higher tax rates in the future.9 The calculator detailed in this manual is designed not merely to compute a number, but to quantify and enable this strategic decision.

### **Core Mechanics of a Roth Conversion**

To build an accurate calculator, a foundational understanding of the Internal Revenue Code's rules governing conversions is essential. Several key mechanics dictate the tax consequences and strategic viability of a conversion.

#### **The Pro-Rata Rule**

A common misconception is that an individual can selectively convert only the after-tax (nondeductible) contributions from a traditional IRA to avoid taxation. The IRS prevents this through the pro-rata rule. For tax purposes, the IRS aggregates and treats all of an individual's traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs as a single, consolidated account.12 Any distribution or conversion is deemed to consist of a proportional (pro-rata) mix of pre-tax and after-tax funds from this aggregated total.

The taxable portion of a conversion is calculated using IRS Form 8606\. The formula is as follows:

Taxable Percentage=1−Total Value of All Traditional IRAs (as of Dec 31)Total Basis in All Traditional IRAs​  
Taxable Amount of Conversion=Conversion Amount×Taxable Percentage  
For example, if a user has a total of $100,000 across all their traditional IRAs, of which $20,000 consists of after-tax (nondeductible) contributions (their "basis"), then 80% of their total IRA value is pre-tax. If they choose to convert $50,000, the pro-rata rule dictates that 80% of that conversion, or $40,000, is taxable income. They cannot simply convert $20,000 of basis tax-free.5

#### **The 5-Year Holding Periods**

There are two distinct 5-year rules associated with Roth IRAs that are critical to understand but often confused.

1. **The Overall 5-Year Rule for Earnings:** To withdraw *earnings* from a Roth IRA tax-free, the owner must be at least age 59½ and it must be at least five years since they *first* contributed to *any* Roth IRA. This clock starts on January 1 of the tax year for which the first contribution was made.  
2. **The Per-Conversion 5-Year Rule for Penalties:** Each individual Roth conversion has its own separate 5-year holding period. If an individual withdraws any part of a converted amount before this 5-year period is over, the withdrawal may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty, unless the individual is over age 59½ or another exception applies. This rule prevents the use of Roth conversions to circumvent early withdrawal penalties on traditional IRAs.12

#### **Sourcing Tax Payments**

A pivotal strategic decision is how to pay the income tax liability generated by the conversion. The optimal approach is almost universally to pay the taxes from a non-retirement, taxable account (e.g., a brokerage or savings account). If funds are withheld from the conversion amount itself to pay the taxes, two negative consequences occur:

* The funds used for taxes are considered a distribution, not a conversion. If the account owner is under age 59½, this portion will be subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty.4  
* The amount used to pay taxes is no longer in the Roth IRA, forfeiting the opportunity for future tax-free growth. This diminishes the long-term benefit of the conversion strategy.15

The calculator's model will assume taxes are paid from an outside source, as this reflects best practices and maximizes the conversion's financial utility.15

## **Part II: Deconstructing the 2025 Tax Landscape Under OBBBA**

The algorithm's accuracy is wholly dependent on a precise model of the 2025 tax code. The OBBBA legislation has solidified the TCJA framework but introduced significant new complexities, particularly in the form of new deductions with intricate income-based phase-outs. This section serves as the definitive data reference for the calculator's core logic.

### **Federal Income Tax Brackets & Standard Deductions**

OBBBA permanently extends the seven marginal tax rates established by the TCJA. For 2025, the brackets, which are adjusted for inflation, are the primary determinants of the "headroom" available for a conversion.2The legislation also permanently increases the standard deduction and provides for further inflation adjustments.2

The table below outlines the foundational figures for the 2025 tax year. The calculator's primary objective is to add income from a conversion that fills a given bracket (e.g., the 22% bracket) up to the threshold where the next bracket (e.g., 24%) begins.

**Table 2.1: 2025 Federal Income Tax Brackets and Standard Deductions** 18

| Filing Status | Tax Rate | Taxable Income Range | 2025 Standard Deduction | Additional Standard Deduction (Age 65+ / Blind) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Single | 10% | $0 to $11,925 | $15,750 | $2,000 per condition |
|  | 12% | $11,926 to $48,475 |  |  |
|  | 22% | $48,476 to $103,350 |  |  |
|  | 24% | $103,351 to $197,300 |  |  |
|  | 32% | $197,301 to $250,525 |  |  |
|  | 35% | $250,526 to $626,350 |  |  |
|  | 37% | $626,351 or more |  |  |
| Married Filing Jointly | 10% | $0 to $23,850 | $31,500 | $1,600 per qualifying spouse/condition |
|  | 12% | $23,851 to $96,950 |  |  |
|  | 22% | $96,951 to $206,700 |  |  |
|  | 24% | $206,701 to $394,600 |  |  |
|  | 32% | $394,601 to $501,050 |  |  |
|  | 35% | $501,051 to $751,600 |  |  |
|  | 37% | $751,601 or more |  |  |
| Head of Household | 10% | $0 to $17,000 | $23,625 | $2,000 per condition |
|  | 12% | $17,001 to $64,850 |  |  |
|  | 22% | $64,851 to $103,350 |  |  |
|  | 24% | $103,351 to $197,300 |  |  |
|  | 32% | $197,301 to $250,500 |  |  |
|  | 35% | $250,501 to $626,350 |  |  |
|  | 37% | $626,351 or more |  |  |

Note: The OBBBA-introduced standard deduction amounts of $15,750 (Single) and $31,500 (MFJ) reflect a slight increase over the previously projected 2025 TCJA amounts.2 The additional standard deduction amounts for age/blindness are from pre-OBBBA law and remain in effect.18

### **A Comprehensive Guide to OBBBA's New & Modified Deductions**

The most significant challenge in modeling Roth conversions under OBBBA is accounting for the new suite of deductions, nearly all of which are subject to phase-outs based on Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). A Roth conversion directly increases MAGI, which can reduce or eliminate these deductions. This reduction in deductions, in turn, increases taxable income, thereby reducing the available "headroom" for the conversion. This feedback loop is the central problem the iterative algorithm in Part III is designed to solve.

For most taxpayers, MAGI is equivalent to Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). The specific definitions can vary slightly by tax provision, but for the purposes of these new deductions, AGI is a reliable proxy.2 All new deductions introduced by OBBBA are "below-the-line," meaning they reduce taxable income but do not reduce AGI itself.2

**Table 2.2: 2025 Federal Deductions & AGI/MAGI Phase-Out Thresholds** 1

| Deduction Name | Type | Max Amount (Single / MFJ) | Phase-Out Start (MAGI) (Single / MFJ) | Phase-Out End (MAGI) (Single / MFJ) | Phase-Out Rate |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Senior Deduction (65+)** | Below-the-line | $6,000 / $12,000 | $75,000 / $150,000 | $175,000 / $250,000 | 6% |
| **SALT Deduction** | Itemized | $40,000 | $500,000 | $600,000 | 30% (floor of $10k) |
| **Qualified Tips** | Below-the-line | $25,000 | $150,000 / $300,000 | $400,000 / $550,000 | $100 per $1,000 of MAGI |
| **Qualified Overtime** | Below-the-line | $12,500 / $25,000 | $150,000 / $300,000 | $275,000 / $550,000 | $100 per $1,000 of MAGI |
| **Auto Loan Interest** | Below-the-line | $10,000 | $100,000 / $200,000 | $150,000 / $250,000 | 20% |
| **QBI (Sec. 199A)** | Below-the-line | 23% of QBI | $197,300 / $394,600 (SSTB) | $272,300 / $544,600 (SSTB) | Pro-rata |
| **Child Tax Credit** | Credit | $2,200 per child | $200,000 / $400,000 | N/A | $50 per $1,000 of AGI |

Note on SALT Deduction: The phase-out reduces the cap from $40,000 down to a floor of $10,000. For MFJ, the $30,000 difference is phased out at a 30% rate over the $100,000 income range from $500k to $600k.2

Note on QBI: OBBBA increased the deduction from 20% to 23% and expanded the phase-out range for Specified Service Trades or Businesses (SSTBs).2 The thresholds shown are for SSTBs; the deduction is generally available to non-SSTB businesses regardless of income, subject to wage/capital limitations.

### **State Tax Integration: The Massachusetts Example**

A comprehensive conversion analysis must include state income taxes, as they represent a direct and significant cost of the transaction. The software architecture should be modular to accommodate the unique tax laws of different states. Using Massachusetts as a case study demonstrates how this modularity can be achieved.

Unlike the federal progressive bracket system, Massachusetts imposes a flat 5% income tax on most forms of income, including the ordinary income generated by a Roth conversion.25 For 2025, it also levies an additional 4% surtax on annual income exceeding $1,083,150.27

Crucially, Massachusetts does not have a standard deduction. Instead, it provides personal exemptions, which vary by filing status ($4,400 for Single, $8,800 for MFJ in 2024, with 2025 figures likely similar).28 The state tax calculation generally begins with the federal AGI.

This structure leads to a clear architectural design pattern:

1. A core engine calculates the federal tax liability and determines the final post-conversion federal AGI.  
2. This federal AGI is then passed as an input to a separate, state-specific module (e.g., calculateMassachusettsTax).  
3. This module applies the relevant state rules (flat rate, surtax, personal exemptions) to the federal AGI to determine the state tax liability.

This approach isolates the complexity of federal calculations from state-level variations, allowing the application to be extended to other states (e.g., California with its progressive brackets, or Florida with no income tax) by simply adding new state-specific modules without altering the core federal engine.

## **Part III: The "Bracket Froth" Algorithm: A Step-by-Step Financial Model**

This section translates the complex tax rules from Part II into a precise, step-by-step computational algorithm. The goal is to calculate the maximum amount that can be converted to "fill up" the user's current marginal tax bracket to a specified threshold (e.g., 95%) while correctly accounting for the cascading impact of the conversion on AGI-sensitive deductions.

### **Establishing the Baseline: Pre-Conversion Taxable Income**

The first step is to establish a clear financial baseline for the user *before* any conversion is considered. This requires gathering essential data points and performing an initial tax calculation.

**Required User Inputs:**

* **Filing Status:** Single, Married Filing Jointly, Head of Household.  
* **Personal Information:** Age of taxpayer (and spouse, if applicable), number of qualifying children/dependents.  
* **Income:** Wages/Salary, Taxable Interest, Ordinary Dividends, Qualified Dividends, Long-Term Capital Gains, Short-Term Capital Gains, Social Security Benefits, Other Income.  
* **Pre-Tax Retirement Accounts:** Total value of all Traditional/SEP/SIMPLE IRAs, total non-deductible basis in those IRAs.  
* **Deduction-Specific Inputs:** State and Local Taxes (SALT) paid, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, qualified tip income, qualified overtime income, auto loan interest on qualifying vehicles.

**Baseline Calculation Steps:**

1. **Calculate Gross Income:** Sum all income sources.  
2. **Calculate Adjusted Gross Income (AGI):** Gross Income minus any "above-the-line" deductions (e.g., traditional IRA contributions, student loan interest). For this model, we will assume the primary inputs are post-deduction and focus on the below-the-line deductions affected by OBBBA. The user's provided income figures will form the baselineAGI.  
3. **Determine Standard vs. Itemized Deduction:** Calculate the user's potential itemized deductions. Compare this to their standard deduction from Table 2.1. The larger of the two is used.  
4. **Calculate All Applicable Deductions:** Based on the baselineAGI, calculate the value of each applicable deduction from Table 2.2.  
5. **Calculate Baseline Taxable Income:** baselineTaxableIncome \= baselineAGI \- (Larger of Standard/Itemized Deduction) \- (All other below-the-line deductions).

This baselineTaxableIncome represents the user's starting point within their marginal tax bracket.

### **Calculating the Bracket Headroom**

With the baseline established, the next step is to determine the naive amount of "space" left in the user's current tax bracket.

1. **Identify Current Bracket:** Using baselineTaxableIncome and Table 2.1, determine the user's current marginal tax rate (e.g., 22%).  
2. **Find Bracket Ceiling:** From Table 2.1, find the maximum income for that bracket (e.g., $103,350 for a Single filer in the 22% bracket). This is the bracketCeiling.  
3. **Calculate Initial Headroom:** The initial, naive estimate for the maximum conversion is:  
   initialHeadroom=bracketCeiling−baselineTaxableIncome

This value is incorrect because it fails to account for the feedback loop where the conversion itself will change the final taxable income. However, it serves as the crucial starting point for the iterative process.

### **The Iterative Refinement Algorithm**

This is the intellectual core of the calculator. It solves the circular dependency where the conversion amount affects AGI, which affects deductions, which affects taxable income, which in turn affects the allowable conversion amount. A direct algebraic solution is unwieldy; an iterative numerical method is far more robust and practical.

The algorithm works by starting with an optimistic guess (the initialHeadroom) and repeatedly refining it downward until it converges on a stable solution.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Initialization:**  
   * Calculate baselineAGI and baselineTaxableIncome as described in Section 3.1.  
   * Calculate initialHeadroom as described in Section 3.2.  
   * Set potentialConversionAmount \= initialHeadroom.  
   * Set a tolerance value (e.g., $1.00) and a maxIterations limit (e.g., 100\) to prevent infinite loops.  
2. **Iterative Loop:**  
   * **Start Loop (for i from 1 to maxIterations):**  
   * **Step A: Calculate Post-Conversion MAGI.** Calculate a new MAGI based on the current guess for the conversion amount.  
     newMAGI=baselineAGI+potentialConversionAmount  
   * **Step B: Recalculate All Phased-Out Deductions.** Using newMAGI, go through each deduction listed in Table 2.2. Apply the phase-out rules to determine the new, likely smaller, value for each deduction. For example, for the Senior Deduction (Single filer):  
     * phaseoutAmount \= (newMAGI \- $75,000) \* 0.06  
     * newSeniorDeduction \= max(0, $6,000 \- phaseoutAmount)  
     * Sum all recalculated deductions to get totalRecalculatedDeductions.  
   * **Step C: Recalculate Taxable Income.** Determine the new total taxable income.  
     newTaxableIncome=newMAGI−(Standard/Itemized Deduction)−totalRecalculatedDeductions  
   * **Step D: Calculate New Headroom.** This is the crucial step. The new headroom represents the "true" space available, given the impact of the lost deductions.  
     newHeadroom=potentialConversionAmount+(bracketCeiling−newTaxableIncome)  
     *This formula adjusts the previous guess by the amount it "overshot" the bracket ceiling.*  
   * **Step E: Check for Convergence.** Compare the new estimate with the previous one.  
     change=∣newHeadroom−potentialConversionAmount∣  
     * If change \< tolerance, the algorithm has converged. Break the loop. The stable value is newHeadroom.  
   * **Step F: Update and Repeat.** If not converged, set potentialConversionAmount \= newHeadroomand continue to the next iteration.  
3. **Final Calculation:**  
   * The converged value, finalOptimalConversion, is the maximum amount that can be converted without breaking into the next tax bracket.  
   * The target conversion amount, per the user's request, is:  
     targetConversionAmount=finalOptimalConversion×0.95

This iterative process correctly models the real-world tax impact, revealing that the true "cost" of a conversion includes not only the direct tax on the converted amount but also the indirect cost of any tax benefits that are phased out by the resulting increase in income.4

### **Pseudocode and Logical Flowcharts**

To aid in implementation, the following pseudocode formalizes the algorithm.

    // Part 5: Calculate Secondary Impacts (See Part IV)  
    secondaryImpacts \= calculateSecondaryImpacts(userInput, finalOptimalConversion)  
      
    RETURN {  
        optimalConversion: finalOptimalConversion,  
        targetConversion: targetConversionAmount,  
        taxCost: calculateTax(finalOptimalConversion,...),  
        impacts: secondaryImpacts  
    }

FUNCTION calculateAllDeductions(userInput, currentAGI):  
    // Calculate standard deduction based on filing status, age  
    // Calculate itemized deductions (e.g., SALT cap based on currentAGI)  
    // Choose larger of standard or itemized  
    // Calculate all OBBBA below-the-line deductions with phase-outs based on currentAGI  
    // Return a structured object with all deduction values and their total

A flowchart visually representing this logic would show the initial linear calculation leading into the circular, iterative loop, which then exits to the final calculation and secondary impact analysis.

## **Part IV: Advanced Considerations: Navigating the Secondary Impact Thresholds**

A truly expert-level tool does not stop at calculating the tax cost. It must proactively identify and quantify the significant, often hidden, secondary financial consequences of a large income event like a Roth conversion. The increase in MAGI can trigger several "tax torpedoes" that can dramatically alter the cost-benefit analysis of the conversion. The calculator must function as a warning system for these thresholds.

### **Social Security Taxation Analysis**

For retirees receiving Social Security, a Roth conversion can cause a greater portion of their benefits to become taxable. The taxability is based on "provisional income" (sometimes called combined income).

The formula is:

Provisional Income=AGI+Nontaxable Interest+21​×Annual Social Security Benefits  
The income from a Roth conversion directly increases AGI, which in turn increases provisional income. This can push a taxpayer across two key thresholds 29:

* **First Threshold (50% Taxable):**  
  * Single: $25,000 to $34,000  
  * MFJ: $32,000 to $44,000  
* **Second Threshold (85% Taxable):**  
  * Single: Above $34,000  
  * MFJ: Above $44,000

The algorithm must include a module that calculates the user's provisional income both *before* and *after* the proposed conversion. It should then calculate the additional income tax owed due to the increased portion of taxable Social Security benefits and display this as a distinct cost component of the conversion.6 This creates a secondary feedback loop, as the newly taxable portion of Social Security benefits also increases AGI, which must be accounted for in the final tax calculation.

### **The Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) Trigger**

The Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) is a 3.8% surtax on the lesser of a taxpayer's net investment income (NII) or the amount their MAGI exceeds certain thresholds.32

* **NIIT Thresholds (not indexed for inflation):**  
  * Single / Head of Household: $200,000  
  * Married Filing Jointly: $250,000

While the income from a Roth conversion itself is *not* considered NII, it absolutely increases MAGI.33 A taxpayer could have significant investment income (e.g., capital gains, dividends) but be under the MAGI threshold. A large Roth conversion can push their MAGI over the threshold, thereby subjecting their previously untaxed (by NIIT) investment income to the 3.8% surtax.5

The calculator must perform this check:

1. Gather the user's NII (capital gains, dividends, taxable interest, etc.).  
2. Calculate the post-conversion MAGI.  
3. If postConversionMAGI \> niitThreshold, calculate the NIIT:  
   $$\\text{MAGI Overage} \= \\text{postConversionMAGI} \- \\text{niitThreshold} $$ $$ \\text{NIIT} \= 0.038 \\times \\min(\\text{User NII}, \\text{MAGI Overage})$$  
4. Display the calculated NIIT as a potential hidden cost of the conversion.

### **The Medicare IRMAA "Tax Torpedo"**

Perhaps the most financially damaging and least understood consequence of a Roth conversion for pre-retirees and retirees is the Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA). IRMAA is a surcharge that high-income beneficiaries pay on their Medicare Part B and Part D premiums.35

Critically, IRMAA is determined by a **two-year look-back** at the beneficiary's MAGI.36 This means that a Roth conversion performed in 2025 will directly impact their Medicare premiums in 2027\. The income thresholds for IRMAA are cliffs, not gradual phase-outs; exceeding a tier by just $1 triggers the full premium increase for that tier for the entire year.37

The calculator must provide a clear, forward-looking warning. It will take the user's calculated postConversionMAGI for 2025 and map it to the official IRMAA brackets to project the future premium increase.

**Table 4.1: Projected 2025 Medicare IRMAA Surcharges (Based on 2023 MAGI)** 35

| Filing Status | 2023 MAGI for 2025 Premiums | Monthly Part B Surcharge | Monthly Part D Surcharge |

*Note: The table uses actual 2025 IRMAA figures based on 2023 MAGI for illustration. The application should be updatable with new figures annually. The calculator's output should clearly state: "A conversion of this size in 2025 is projected to increase your annual Medicare premiums by $X,XXX starting in 2027."*

### **Integrating Warnings and Scenarios**

The user interface must present these secondary impacts clearly, not as footnotes, but as primary results of the calculation. The optimal design, inspired by leading financial planning software, would include 15:

1. **Primary Result:** Display the calculated 95% optimal conversion amount and the estimated federal and state tax liability.  
2. **Warning Panel:** A distinct, visually highlighted section detailing the secondary impacts:  
   * "Additional tax due to increased Social Security taxability: $X"  
   * "Additional Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) triggered: $Y"  
   * "Projected annual increase in Medicare premiums in two years: $Z"  
3. **Scenario Modeling:** Provide a slider or input field that is pre-filled with the optimal conversion amount. This allows the user to manually adjust the conversion amount downward to see how they can strategically stay below the NIIT or a specific IRMAA threshold. As the user adjusts the slider, the tax cost and all secondary impact warnings should update in real-time. This transforms the tool from a static calculator into an interactive planning environment.

## **Part V: Full-Stack Implementation Guide**

This part provides the technical blueprint and complete source code for building the Roth conversion calculator as a secure, production-ready, full-stack application.

### **Technical Foundation: Precision and Security**

Financial applications demand the highest standards of accuracy and security. The choice of underlying technologies and data handling practices is paramount.

#### **High-Precision Arithmetic**

Standard JavaScript Number types are floating-point numbers with limited precision (approximately 16 digits) and are susceptible to rounding errors.38 For example, 

0.1 \+ 0.2 famously does not equal 0.3 in floating-point math. Such inaccuracies are unacceptable in financial calculations.

To ensure absolute precision, all monetary calculations in the backend logic must be performed using a dedicated arbitrary-precision decimal library. decimal.js is an excellent choice due to its robustness, comprehensive feature set, and use in other major math libraries.39 It allows for calculations on numbers as strings or its own 

Decimal object, completely avoiding floating-point errors.

#### **Secure Database Schema and Practices**

The application will use a PostgreSQL database, which offers robust features for handling financial data securely.

**Data Types:** All columns intended to store currency values (e.g., income, deduction amounts, conversion amounts) must use the NUMERIC(precision, scale) or DECIMAL(precision, scale) data type. A common and safe choice is NUMERIC(18, 2\), which can store values up to 9,999,999,999,999,999.99 with exact precision. Using FLOAT or REAL for monetary values is a critical error and must be avoided.41

Database Schema (SQL):

The database will store user input profiles to allow for saved scenarios.

SQL  
\-- PostgreSQL CREATE TABLE statement for user input profiles  
CREATE TABLE user\_financial\_profiles (  
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  
    user\_id INTEGER NOT NULL, \-- Foreign key to a users table  
    profile\_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  
    filing\_status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  
    tax\_year INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 2025,  
    age\_taxpayer INTEGER NOT NULL,  
    age\_spouse INTEGER,  
      
    \-- Income  
    wages NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
    taxable\_interest NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
    qualified\_dividends NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
    long\_term\_capital\_gains NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
    social\_security\_benefits NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
      
    \-- Deductions  
    salt\_paid NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
    charitable\_contributions NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
    tip\_income NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
    overtime\_income NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
    auto\_loan\_interest NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
      
    \-- IRA Basis  
    total\_traditional\_ira\_value NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,  
    total\_ira\_basis NUMERIC(18, 2\) DEFAULT 0.00,

    created\_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),  
    updated\_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

    UNIQUE (user\_id, profile\_name)  
);

**Security Practices:**

* **Encryption in Transit:** The connection between the Node.js application and the PostgreSQL server must be encrypted using SSL/TLS. The connection string should specify ssl=require.42  
* **Encryption at Rest:** Sensitive financial data stored in the database should be encrypted. This can be achieved through Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) offered by cloud providers or by using PostgreSQL extensions like pgcrypto for column-level encryption.42  
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** The application's database user should be granted only the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE on specific tables), not superuser privileges.42  
* **Credential Management:** Database credentials must never be hardcoded in the application. They should be managed through environment variables, which are securely injected into the application environment, for example via a .env file in development or a secret management system (like Kubernetes Secrets or AWS Secrets Manager) in production.45

### **Secure Backend Architecture & Code (Node.js, TypeScript, Express)**

The backend will be a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It will expose a single, secure endpoint to perform the complex conversion calculation.

#### **Core Backend Code**

src/constants/taxData.ts

This file will contain all the tax figures from Part II as structured objects, making the code clean and easy to update annually.

TypeScript  
// src/constants/taxData.ts  
import { Decimal } from 'decimal.js';

// Example structure for tax brackets  
export const TAX\_BRACKETS\_2025 \= {  
  single:,  
  marriedFilingJointly:,  
  //...  
};

// Example structure for a deduction  
export const SENIOR\_DEDUCTION\_2025 \= {  
  single: {  
    amount: new Decimal(6000),  
    phaseOutStart: new Decimal(75000),  
    phaseOutEnd: new Decimal(175000),  
    rate: new Decimal(0.06),  
  },  
  //...  
};

//... All other tax data from Tables 2.1, 2.2, and 4.1

src/services/rothService.ts

This service contains the implementation of the iterative algorithm.

TypeScript  
// src/services/rothService.ts  
import { Decimal } from 'decimal.js';  
import { TAX\_BRACKETS\_2025, SENIOR\_DEDUCTION\_2025 /\*,... other tax data \*/ } from '../constants/taxData';

// Set precision for all calculations  
Decimal.set({ precision: 20 });

// Define input and output types  
interface UserInput {  
  filingStatus: 'single' | 'marriedFilingJointly';  
  baselineAGI: string; // Passed as string to avoid precision loss  
  //... all other user inputs  
}

interface CalculationResult {  
  optimalConversion: string;  
  targetConversion: string;  
  //... other results  
}

export class RothService {

    // 1\. Calculate baseline taxable income  
    const baselineDeductions \= this.calculateAllDeductions(baselineAGI, input);  
    const baselineTaxableIncome \= baselineAGI.minus(baselineDeductions.total);

    // 2\. Find bracket and initial headroom  
    const brackets \= TAX\_BRACKETS\_2025;  
    const currentBracket \= brackets.find(b \=\> baselineTaxableIncome.lessThanOrEqualTo(b.ceiling));  
    if (\!currentBracket) {  
      // Handle case where income is already in the top bracket  
      return { optimalConversion: '0.00', targetConversion: '0.00' };  
    }  
    const bracketCeiling \= currentBracket.ceiling;  
    let potentialConversionAmount \= bracketCeiling.minus(baselineTaxableIncome);

    // 3\. Iterative Refinement  
    const TOLERANCE \= new Decimal(1.00);  
    const MAX\_ITERATIONS \= 100;

    for (let i \= 0; i \< MAX\_ITERATIONS; i++) {  
      const newMAGI \= baselineAGI.plus(potentialConversionAmount);  
      const recalculatedDeductions \= this.calculateAllDeductions(newMAGI, input);  
      const newTaxableIncome \= newMAGI.minus(recalculatedDeductions.total);  
        
      const overshoot \= newTaxableIncome.minus(bracketCeiling);  
      const newHeadroom \= potentialConversionAmount.minus(overshoot);

      if (newHeadroom.minus(potentialConversionAmount).abs().lessThan(TOLERANCE)) {  
        potentialConversionAmount \= newHeadroom;  
        break;  
      }  
      potentialConversionAmount \= newHeadroom;  
    }

    const finalOptimalConversion \= potentialConversionAmount.isNegative()? new Decimal(0) : potentialConversionAmount;  
    const targetConversion \= finalOptimalConversion.times(0.95);

    return {  
      optimalConversion: finalOptimalConversion.toDP(2).toString(),  
      targetConversion: targetConversion.toDP(2).toString(),  
    };  
  }

  private calculateAllDeductions(currentAGI: Decimal, input: UserInput): { total: Decimal; \[key: string\]: Decimal } {  
    // Implement logic for all deductions from Table 2.2  
    // Example for Senior Deduction (single)  
    const seniorDeductionInfo \= SENIOR\_DEDUCTION\_2025.single;

    const totalDeductions \= seniorDeduction.plus(/\* other deductions \*/);  
      
    return { total: totalDeductions, seniorDeduction };  
  }  
}

src/controllers/rothController.ts

This controller handles the API request, calls the service, and sends the response.

TypeScript  
// src/controllers/rothController.ts  
import { Request, Response } from 'express';  
import { RothService } from '../services/rothService';

const rothService \= new RothService();

export const calculateConversion \= (req: Request, res: Response) \=\> {  
  try {  
    // Input validation would have already been done by middleware  
    const userInput \= req.body;  
    const result \= rothService.calculateOptimalConversion(userInput);  
    res.status(200).json(result);  
  } catch (error) {  
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'An error occurred during calculation.' });  
  }  
};

src/server.ts

This file sets up the Express server and applies security middleware.

TypeScript  
// src/server.ts  
import express from 'express';  
import helmet from 'helmet';  
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';  
import dotenv from 'dotenv';  
import rothRoutes from './routes/rothRoutes';

dotenv.config();

const app \= express();  
const PORT \= process.env.PORT |

| 3001;

// Security Middleware  
app.use(helmet());  
app.use(express.json());

const limiter \= rateLimit({  
  windowMs: 15 \* 60 \* 1000, // 15 minutes  
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs  
  standardHeaders: true,  
  legacyHeaders: false,  
});  
app.use(limiter);

// Routes  
app.use('/api/v1/roth-calculator', rothRoutes);

app.listen(PORT, () \=\> {  
  console.log(\`Server is running on port ${PORT}\`);  
});

### **Interactive Frontend Code (React, TypeScript)**

The frontend provides the user interface for inputting data and viewing the results of the complex backend calculation. It will be built with React and TypeScript, using functional components and hooks.

#### **Project Setup**

Bash  
npx create-react-app roth-calculator-frontend \--template typescript  
cd roth-calculator-frontend  
npm install axios

#### **Component Architecture**

src/components/UserInputForm.tsx

This component contains the form for all user inputs. It manages its own state and has a submit handler that passes the data up to the parent.

TypeScript  
// src/components/UserInputForm.tsx  
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Define the shape of the form data  
interface FormData {  
  filingStatus: 'single' | 'marriedFilingJointly';  
  baselineAGI: string;  
  //... other fields  
}

interface Props {  
  onSubmit: (data: FormData) \=\> void;  
  isLoading: boolean;  
}

export const UserInputForm: React.FC\<Props\> \= ({ onSubmit, isLoading }) \=\> {  
  const \= useState\<FormData\>({  
    filingStatus: 'single',  
    baselineAGI: '',  
    //... initial values  
  });

  const handleChange \= (e: React.ChangeEvent\<HTMLInputElement | HTMLSelectElement\>) \=\> {  
    const { name, value } \= e.target;  
    setFormData(prev \=\> ({...prev, \[name\]: value }));  
  };

  const handleSubmit \= (e: React.FormEvent) \=\> {  
    e.preventDefault();  
    onSubmit(formData);  
  };

  return (  
    \<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}\>  
      {/\* Filing Status Selector \*/}  
      \<div\>  
        \<label htmlFor="filingStatus"\>Filing Status\</label\>  
        \<select name="filingStatus" value={formData.filingStatus} onChange={handleChange}\>  
          \<option value="single"\>Single\</option\>  
          \<option value="marriedFilingJointly"\>Married Filing Jointly\</option\>  
        \</select\>  
      \</div\>

      {/\* Baseline AGI Input \*/}  
      \<div\>  
        \<label htmlFor="baselineAGI"\>Estimated Annual AGI\</label\>  
        \<input  
          type="number"  
          name="baselineAGI"  
          value={formData.baselineAGI}  
          onChange={handleChange}  
          placeholder="e.g., 85000"  
        /\>  
      \</div\>

      {/\*... Other input fields for income, age, deductions etc. \*/}

      \<button type="submit" disabled={isLoading}\>  
        {isLoading? 'Calculating...' : 'Calculate Conversion'}  
      \</button\>  
    \</form\>  
  );  
};

src/components/ResultsDisplay.tsx

This component is responsible for displaying the primary calculation results.

TypeScript  
// src/components/ResultsDisplay.tsx  
import React from 'react';

interface Props {  
  results: {  
    targetConversion: string;  
    //... other primary results  
  } | null;  
}

export const ResultsDisplay: React.FC\<Props\> \= ({ results }) \=\> {  
  if (\!results) return null;

  return (  
    \<div className="results-container"\>  
      \<h3\>Optimal Conversion Amount\</h3\>  
      \<p\>  
        To stay within your current tax bracket (with a 5% buffer), you can convert up to:  
      \</p\>  
      \<div className="result-amount"\>  
        ${parseFloat(results.targetConversion).toLocaleString('en-US', { minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 2 })}  
      \</div\>  
      {/\* Display tax cost and other primary results here \*/}  
    \</div\>  
  );  
};

src/pages/RothCalculatorPage.tsx

This is the main container page that orchestrates the state, API calls, and child components.

TypeScript  
// src/pages/RothCalculatorPage.tsx  
import React, { useState } from 'react';  
import axios from 'axios';  
import { UserInputForm } from '../components/UserInputForm';  
import { ResultsDisplay } from '../components/ResultsDisplay';  
// Import SecondaryImpacts component here

// Define types for API data  
interface FormData { /\*... \*/ }  
interface ApiResult {  
  targetConversion: string;  
  //...  
}

export const RothCalculatorPage: React.FC \= () \=\> {  
  const \= useState\<ApiResult | null\>(null);  
  const \[isLoading, setIsLoading\] \= useState(false);  
  const \[error, setError\] \= useState\<string | null\>(null);

  const handleFormSubmit \= async (data: FormData) \=\> {  
    setIsLoading(true);  
    setError(null);  
    setResults(null);  
    try {  
      const response \= await axios.post('/api/v1/roth-calculator/calculate', data);  
      setResults(response.data);  
    } catch (err) {  
      setError('Failed to calculate. Please check your inputs and try again.');  
      console.error(err);  
    } finally {  
      setIsLoading(false);  
    }  
  };

  return (  
    \<div\>  
      \<h1\>Strategic Roth Conversion Calculator (2025)\</h1\>  
      \<p\>This tool calculates the optimal amount to convert from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, filling up your current tax bracket without pushing you into the next one.\</p\>  
        
      \<UserInputForm onSubmit={handleFormSubmit} isLoading={isLoading} /\>

      {error && \<div className="error-message"\>{error}\</div\>}  
        
      {results && (  
        \<\>  
          \<ResultsDisplay results={results} /\>  
          {/\* \<SecondaryImpacts results={results} /\> \*/}  
        \</\>  
      )}  
    \</div\>  
  );  
};

This structure provides a robust, secure, and maintainable foundation for the financial planning software. The separation of concerns between the frontend (UI/UX), backend (secure business logic), and database (persistent storage) is a cornerstone of modern web application architecture.47
