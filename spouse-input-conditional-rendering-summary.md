# ✅ Spouse Input Conditional Rendering - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Summary

I have successfully implemented conditional rendering for all spouse-related inputs in the optimization form based on marital status. Now single users will only see inputs relevant to them, while married/partnered users will see both user and spouse inputs.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Added isMarried Boolean Flag**
```typescript
const isMarried = (profile?.maritalStatus === 'married' || profile?.maritalStatus === 'partnered');
```
- Added near the profile state declaration
- Centralized logic for determining marital status
- Consistent across all spouse input conditions

### 2. **Updated Mini-Summary Display**
```typescript
// Before: Always showed "67 / 65" format
<p className="text-white font-medium">{variables.retirementAge} / {variables.spouseRetirementAge}</p>

// After: Shows spouse values only if married
<p className="text-white font-medium">
  {isMarried ? `${variables.retirementAge} / ${variables.spouseRetirementAge}` : variables.retirementAge}
</p>
```

### 3. **Wrapped Spouse-Specific Inputs with Conditional Rendering**

#### Spouse Retirement Age:
```typescript
{isMarried && (
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <Label htmlFor="spouse-retirement-age" className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-300">
      Spouse Retirement Age
    </Label>
    // ... input component
  </div>
)}
```

#### Spouse Investment Strategy:
```typescript
{isMarried && (
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <Label className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-300 flex items-center">
      Spouse Investment Strategy
      // ... tooltip and select component
    </Label>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Spouse Retirement Contributions Section:
```typescript
{isMarried && (
  <div className="md:col-span-2 space-y-4 p-4 bg-gray-800/30 rounded-lg border border-gray-700">
    <h4 className="text-sm font-semibold text-white">Spouse Retirement Contributions</h4>
    // ... all spouse 401k and IRA contribution inputs
  </div>
)}
```

#### Spouse Part-Time Income:
```typescript
{isMarried && (
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <Label htmlFor="spouse-part-time-income" className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-300 flex items-center">
      Spouse Part-Time Retirement Income
      // ... input component
    </Label>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Spouse Social Security (Updated for Consistency):
```typescript
// Updated existing condition to use isMarried variable
{isMarried && (
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <SocialSecurityAgeSelector
      id="spouse-ss-age"
      // ... spouse SS configuration
    />
  </div>
)}
```

## 📋 Inputs Made Conditional

The following spouse-related inputs are now only shown for married/partnered users:

### Age & Timing:
- ✅ Spouse Retirement Age
- ✅ Spouse Social Security Claim Age (was already conditional, now consistent)

### Investment Strategy:
- ✅ Spouse Investment Strategy (asset allocation)

### Contributions:
- ✅ Spouse Monthly 401(k)/403(b) Contribution
- ✅ Spouse Monthly Employer Match
- ✅ Spouse Annual Traditional IRA
- ✅ Spouse Annual Roth IRA

### Income:
- ✅ Spouse Part-Time Retirement Income

### Display Elements:
- ✅ Mini-summary now shows single values for single users
- ✅ All spouse-specific tooltips and labels

## 🎯 User Experience Impact

### For Single Users:
- ✅ **Cleaner Interface:** No irrelevant spouse inputs cluttering the form
- ✅ **Simplified Summary:** Shows only their own values (e.g., "Age 67" instead of "67 / 65")
- ✅ **Focused Experience:** Form is tailored to their actual situation

### For Married/Partnered Users:
- ✅ **Complete Functionality:** All spouse inputs remain available
- ✅ **Consistent Layout:** Same comprehensive optimization as before
- ✅ **No Lost Features:** All existing functionality preserved

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### Conditional Logic:
```typescript
// Central condition
const isMarried = (profile?.maritalStatus === 'married' || profile?.maritalStatus === 'partnered');

// Applied consistently across all spouse inputs
{isMarried && (
  // spouse-specific JSX
)}
```

### Backward Compatibility:
- ✅ **Existing Data:** All existing optimization variables still work
- ✅ **API Compatibility:** Backend continues to handle spouse fields gracefully
- ✅ **Profile Loading:** Logic works correctly before and after profile loads

## ✅ Validation

- **Build Success:** ✅ Project compiles without errors
- **TypeScript:** ✅ No type errors introduced
- **Logic Consistency:** ✅ All spouse inputs use the same `isMarried` condition
- **UI Coherence:** ✅ Form adapts appropriately based on marital status

## 🎯 Result

The optimization form now provides a **tailored experience** based on marital status:
- **Single users** see a streamlined form focused on their individual planning
- **Married users** see the comprehensive form with all spouse-related inputs
- **Dynamic adaptation** based on the user's profile data
- **Consistent UX** across all spouse-related elements

The implementation is clean, maintainable, and follows React best practices for conditional rendering.
