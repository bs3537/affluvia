# Simulation Summary Section Removal

## âœ… Successfully Removed

### **Location**: `client/src/components/retirement-monte-carlo-widget.tsx`

### **Removed Section**: 
- **Lines 619-642**: Complete "Simulation Summary" expandable section
- **Component**: The gray expandable card that showed:
  - ðŸ“Š "Simulation Summary" title with bar chart icon
  - "Successful Scenarios: 0" 
  - "Failed Scenarios: 0"
  - "Detailed portfolio projections available in Retirement Planning section" text

### **Issue Fixed**:
The section was displaying incorrect information (0 successful and 0 failed scenarios) which was misleading users about their retirement simulation results.

### **User Experience Impact**:
- **Before**: Clicking the expandable icon showed confusing "0 successful, 0 failed scenarios" 
- **After**: The expandable section no longer shows this misleading information
- **Result**: Cleaner, more accurate retirement confidence score widget

### **Technical Details**:
- Removed the conditional rendering block: `{monteCarloResult && (...)}`
- Removed the grid layout showing successful/failed scenario counts
- Removed the explanatory text about detailed projections
- Maintained all other functionality of the retirement confidence score widget

### **Build Status**: âœ… Successfully Compiled
All TypeScript compilation and build processes completed successfully after the removal.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Widget Now Shows**:
- Retirement Confidence Score (99 in this case)
- "Highly Confident" status
- "Good news! You could retire 5 years earlier" message
- "Earliest Retirement Age: 60" information
- All other legitimate retirement planning data

The misleading simulation summary with zero values has been completely removed.
