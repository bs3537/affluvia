# How to See Retirement Delay Recommendations

## Where the Recommendations Appear

### 1. **Retirement Planning Page** (/retirement-planning)
- Navigate to the Retirement Planning page
- Look for the **"Optimizing Your Score"** tab (should be the default tab)
- Find the section titled **"Action Items to Improve Your Retirement Score"** with a sparkles icon
- Click on it to expand if it's collapsed
- You'll see 5 numbered recommendations

### 2. **Dashboard** (/dashboard) 
- The general recommendations appear in the **"Insights"** section
- These are generated during profile calculation

## When "Delay Retirement" Recommendation Appears

The "Delay retirement" recommendation will appear when:
- Your retirement confidence score is **below 80%**
- It will suggest delaying by 2 years if score is 60-79%
- It will suggest delaying by 3 years if score is below 60%

## Priority Order of Recommendations

The recommendations follow this priority:
1. **Long-term care insurance** (if not covered)
2. **Maximize 401(k) contributions** (if cash flow available)
3. **Contribute to Traditional or Roth IRA** (if room based on cash flow)
4. **Consider delaying retirement** (if below 80% confidence)
5. **Reduce monthly planned expenses**
6. **Optimize Social Security claiming**
7. **Consider part-time work in retirement**

## How to Test

1. To force a low confidence score for testing:
   - Set a very early retirement age (e.g., 55)
   - Set high monthly expenses in retirement (e.g., $15,000)
   - Set low current savings
   - Don't have long-term care insurance

2. After updating your profile with these values:
   - Go to the Retirement Planning page
   - The system will calculate your score
   - If it's below 80%, you should see "Delay retirement" in the recommendations

## API Endpoint

The recommendations are generated by:
- **Endpoint**: `/api/retirement-optimization-suggestions`
- **Called from**: Retirement Planning page when it loads
- **Uses**: Google Gemini AI to generate personalized suggestions

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the recommendations:
1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Make sure your profile has a retirement confidence score calculated
3. Ensure the Gemini API key is configured
4. Check that the retirement planning page has loaded completely
