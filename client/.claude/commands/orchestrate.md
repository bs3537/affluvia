# Multi-Agent Orchestration Command

Activate the multi-agent system with @agent-supervisor-opus as the main orchestrator to coordinate specialized subagents for complex tasks.

## Usage
Use this command for complex, multi-faceted tasks that require coordination across multiple domains:

- **Feature Development**: Full-stack feature implementation requiring frontend, backend, and database work
- **Performance Optimization**: System-wide performance improvements involving multiple components
- **Security Implementation**: Comprehensive security measures across the entire application
- **Architecture Changes**: Major architectural decisions and refactoring efforts
- **Code Quality Reviews**: Comprehensive code reviews involving multiple specialists

## Command Arguments
$ARGUMENTS should describe the complex task or project that requires multi-agent coordination.

## Example Usage
```
/orchestrate Implement a new retirement calculator feature with real-time Monte Carlo simulations, responsive UI, secure data handling, and performance optimization
```

## Process
1. **Task Analysis**: @agent-supervisor-opus analyzes the requirements and breaks down the task
2. **Agent Assignment**: Specialized subagents are assigned based on task requirements
3. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects
4. **Quality Assurance**: @agent-code-reviewer validates all implementations
5. **Integration**: @agent-supervisor-opus coordinates final integration and testing

## Coordination Flow
The supervisor agent will:
- Use extended thinking to plan the optimal execution strategy
- Delegate specific tasks to appropriate specialist agents
- Monitor progress and coordinate dependencies between agents
- Ensure quality standards and architectural consistency
- Synthesize results into a coherent solution

Invoke @agent-supervisor-opus to orchestrate the following task: $ARGUMENTS

The supervisor should:
1. Use extended thinking to analyze the task complexity and requirements
2. Identify which specialist agents are needed for the task
3. Create a detailed execution plan with task assignments
4. Coordinate the specialist agents in the optimal order
5. Review and integrate all results into a final solution
6. Ensure quality assurance and architectural consistency throughout
