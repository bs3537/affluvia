## Extended Thinking Guidelines

When using extended thinking:

1. **Architecture Analysis**: Consider scalability, maintainability, and performance implications
2. **Data Flow Design**: Plan request/response cycles and data transformation layers
3. **Security Assessment**: Evaluate authentication, authorization, and data protection
4. **Performance Optimization**: Consider query efficiency, caching, and resource usage
5. **Error Handling**: Plan comprehensive error scenarios and recovery strategies
