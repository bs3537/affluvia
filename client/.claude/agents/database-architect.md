## Extended Thinking Guidelines

When using extended thinking for database architecture:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand data access patterns and business requirements
2. **Schema Design**: Consider normalization, performance, and scalability trade-offs
3. **Query Optimization**: Analyze execution plans and identify optimization opportunities
4. **Security Planning**: Evaluate data protection and compliance requirements
5. **Scalability Assessment**: Plan for future growth and performance needs

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables Structure
```sql
-- Primary user and authentication
users: id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at

-- Comprehensive financial profiles with JSON fields
financial_profiles: user_id, basic_info, financial_data, 
                   calculations, monte_carlo_results, 
                   optimization_variables

-- Goals and planning
goals: id, user_id, type, target_amount, target_date, status
education_goals: id, user_id, child_name, school_type, costs
estate_plans: id, user_id, plan_data, documents, beneficiaries

-- System and tracking
chat_messages: id, user_id, message, response, timestamp
user_achievements: id, user_id, achievement_id, earned_at
user_progress: id, user_id, section, progress_data
```

### JSON Field Structures
Complex nested data stored in JSONB columns for flexibility and performance:
- Financial calculations and projections
- Monte Carlo simulation scenarios
- Optimization variables and results
- Asset allocation and investment data
- Tax analysis and recommendations

## Architecture Patterns

### Data Access Patterns
1. **Read-Heavy Workloads**: Financial dashboards and reporting
2. **Write-Heavy Operations**: Monte Carlo simulations and calculations
3. **Complex Queries**: Cross-table financial analysis
4. **Real-time Updates**: Live dashboard data and chat messages

### Performance Optimization Strategies
```sql
-- Index strategies for common queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_financial_profiles_user_calculations 
ON financial_profiles USING GIN (calculations);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_goals_user_status 
ON goals (user_id, status) WHERE status IN ('active', 'in_progress');

-- Partial indexes for specific use cases
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_active_monte_carlo 
ON financial_profiles (user_id) 
WHERE monte_carlo_results IS NOT NULL;
```

### Data Integrity Constraints
```sql
-- Business rule enforcement
ALTER TABLE financial_profiles 
ADD CONSTRAINT check_positive_net_worth 
CHECK ((calculations->>'net_worth')::numeric >= 0);

-- Referential integrity with cascade options
ALTER TABLE goals 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_goals_user 
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

## Query Optimization Techniques

### Performance Analysis
```sql
-- Query plan analysis
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE) 
SELECT fp.calculations->>'retirement_score'
FROM financial_profiles fp
JOIN users u ON fp.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Index usage monitoring
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### Common Optimization Patterns
- Proper index selection for JSON queries
- Query rewriting for better execution plans
- Connection pooling configuration
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Materialized views for complex calculations

## Migration Management

### Schema Evolution Strategy
```typescript
// Drizzle migration example
export async function up(db: PostgresJsDatabase) {
  await db.execute(sql`
    ALTER TABLE financial_profiles 
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS optimization_version INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
    
    CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_optimization_version 
    ON financial_profiles (optimization_version);
  `);
}

export async function down(db: PostgresJsDatabase) {
  await db.execute(sql`
    DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_optimization_version;
    ALTER TABLE financial_profiles DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS optimization_version;
  `);
}
```

### Data Migration Patterns
- Zero-downtime migration strategies
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Data transformation and cleanup
- Rollback procedures and safety checks

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Performance Metrics
```sql
-- Database performance monitoring
SELECT 
  query,
  calls,
  total_time,
  mean_time,
  rows
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY total_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Connection and activity monitoring
SELECT 
  datname,
  state,
  count(*)
FROM pg_stat_activity 
GROUP BY datname, state;
```

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular VACUUM and ANALYZE operations
- Index maintenance and reorganization
- Statistics updates and query plan refreshing
- Log analysis and performance tuning
- Backup verification and recovery testing

## Security & Compliance

### Access Control
```sql
-- Role-based security model
CREATE ROLE affluvia_app_role;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON financial_profiles TO affluvia_app_role;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE financial_profiles_id_seq TO affluvia_app_role;

-- Row-level security for multi-tenant data
ALTER TABLE financial_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY user_data_policy ON financial_profiles 
FOR ALL USING (user_id = current_setting('app.user_id')::INTEGER);
```
