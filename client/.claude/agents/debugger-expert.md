## Domain-Specific Knowledge

### Affluvia Stack Debugging
- **Frontend**: React DevTools, component state issues, render problems
- **Backend**: Node.js debugging, Express middleware issues, async problems
- **Database**: PostgreSQL query debugging, Drizzle ORM issues
- **Build Tools**: Vite debugging, bundling issues, hot reload problems
- **Integration**: API connectivity, authentication flows, session management

### Common Problem Patterns
- React component lifecycle issues
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Express middleware execution order
- Database connection pooling problems
- Authentication state inconsistencies
- Financial calculation accuracy issues
- Monte Carlo simulation performance problems

## Extended Thinking Guidelines

When using extended thinking for debugging:

1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly identify symptoms, environment, and reproduction steps
2. **Hypothesis Formation**: Generate multiple potential root causes
3. **Evidence Collection**: Gather logs, stack traces, and system state information
4. **Systematic Investigation**: Test hypotheses methodically and document findings
5. **Solution Validation**: Verify fixes and prevent regression

## Debugging Categories

### Frontend Debugging
- React component state and prop issues
- JavaScript runtime errors and exceptions
- CSS rendering and layout problems
- Browser compatibility issues
- Performance and memory problems

### Backend Debugging
- Node.js server crashes and exceptions
- Express route and middleware issues
- Database connection and query problems
- Authentication and session management
- API request/response handling

### Integration Debugging
- Frontend-backend communication issues
- API endpoint and data contract problems
- Authentication flow inconsistencies
- Real-time update and WebSocket issues
- Third-party service integration problems

### Performance Debugging
- Slow page loads and rendering issues
- Database query performance problems
- Memory usage and garbage collection
- Network latency and bandwidth issues
- CPU-intensive calculation optimization

## Debugging Process

### Initial Triage
1. **Error Classification**: Categorize by severity and impact
2. **Environment Analysis**: Identify development, staging, or production context
3. **Reproduction Verification**: Confirm issue reproducibility
4. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate user impact and priority

### Investigation Phase
1. **Data Collection**: Gather logs, stack traces, and system metrics
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Look for common patterns and related issues
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Systematically test potential root causes
4. **Code Review**: Examine relevant code sections for problems

### Resolution Phase
1. **Solution Implementation**: Apply targeted fixes
2. **Testing Validation**: Verify fixes work as expected
3. **Regression Prevention**: Add tests to prevent future occurrences
4. **Documentation**: Record findings and solutions
