## Extended Thinking Guidelines

When using extended thinking for security analysis:

1. **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential attack vectors and security risks
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate likelihood and impact of security threats
3. **Defense Strategy**: Plan layered security controls and mitigations
4. **Compliance Mapping**: Ensure alignment with regulatory requirements
5. **Incident Response**: Prepare for security incidents and breaches

## Security Assessment Categories

### Authentication & Authorization
- Password security and hashing implementation
- Session management and timeout policies
- Multi-factor authentication considerations
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- OAuth and third-party authentication security

### Input Validation & Sanitization
```typescript
// Secure input validation patterns
import { z } from 'zod';

const financialInputSchema = z.object({
  income: z.number().min(0).max(10000000),
  assets: z.number().min(0),
  email: z.string().email().max(255),
  age: z.number().int().min(18).max(100)
});

// Sanitize user inputs
const sanitizeInput = (input: string): string => {
  return input.trim().replace(/[<>]/g, '');
};
```

### Database Security
```sql
-- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
SELECT * FROM financial_profiles 
WHERE user_id = $1 AND status = $2;

-- Row-level security policies
CREATE POLICY user_isolation_policy 
ON financial_profiles 
FOR ALL USING (user_id = current_user_id());
```

### API Security
```typescript
// Rate limiting and security middleware
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';
import helmet from 'helmet';

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP'
});

app.use(helmet()); // Security headers
app.use(limiter); // Rate limiting
```

## Security Implementation Patterns

### Secure Session Management
```typescript
// Secure session configuration
app.use(session({
  store: new pgSession({
    pool: db.pool,
    tableName: 'user_sessions'
  }),
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    httpOnly: true,
    maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
    sameSite: 'strict'
  }
}));
```

### Data Encryption
```typescript
// Sensitive data encryption
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';
import crypto from 'crypto';

// Password hashing
const hashPassword = async (password: string): Promise<string> => {
  return bcrypt.hash(password, 12);
};

// Sensitive financial data encryption
const encryptSensitiveData = (data: string, key: string): string => {
  const cipher = crypto.createCipher('aes-256-gcm', key);
  let encrypted = cipher.update(data, 'utf8', 'hex');
  encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
  return encrypted;
};
```

### Security Headers Implementation
```typescript
// Comprehensive security headers
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "fonts.googleapis.com"],
      fontSrc: ["'self'", "fonts.gstatic.com"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"]
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Common Web Application Vulnerabilities
1. **Injection Attacks**: SQL, NoSQL, OS, LDAP injection
2. **Broken Authentication**: Session management flaws
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Inadequate data protection
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**: XML processing vulnerabilities
5. **Broken Access Control**: Authorization bypass issues
6. **Security Misconfiguration**: Default configurations and errors
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Client-side script injection

    console.warn(`Failed login attempt for ${email} from ${ip}`);
  },
  
  logSuspiciousActivity: (userId: string, activity: string) => {
    console.error(`Suspicious activity detected: User ${userId} - ${activity}`);
  },
  
  logDataAccess: (userId: string, resource: string) => {
    console.info(`Data access: User ${userId} accessed ${resource}`);
  }
};
```
