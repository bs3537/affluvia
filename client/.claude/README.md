# Affluvia Claude Subagent System

This directory contains a comprehensive subagent architecture for the Affluvia financial planning application, featuring:

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- **Supervisor Agent**: Claude Opus 4.1 with extended thinking for orchestration
- **8 Specialized Subagents**: Claude Sonnet 4 with extended thinking for domain expertise
- **Coordination System**: Hub-and-spoke pattern with intelligent task routing
- **Persistent Knowledge**: Maintains context and learning across sessions
