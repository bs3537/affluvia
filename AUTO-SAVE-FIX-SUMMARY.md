# Auto-Save Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Client-Side Auto-Save (intake-form.tsx)
- ✅ Added `isPartialSave: true` flag to auto-save requests
- ✅ Added `skipCalculations: true` flag to skip heavy calculations during partial saves
- ✅ Added `currentStep` to track which step is being saved
- ✅ Added console logging for debugging

### 2. Server-Side Handling (routes.ts)
- ✅ Server already checks for `skipCalculations` or `isPartialSave` flags
- ✅ Skips expensive calculations (Monte Carlo, Net Worth projections, Gemini insights) during partial saves
- ✅ Preserves existing scores when doing partial saves

### 3. Data Storage (storage.ts)
- ⚠️ The `isPartialSave`, `skipCalculations`, and `currentStep` fields are filtered out as "invalid columns"
- ✅ This is correct behavior - these are control flags, not data to store

## How Auto-Save Works Now

1. **User fills form data** → React Hook Form tracks changes
2. **After 3 seconds of inactivity** → `useDebouncedSave` triggers
3. **Auto-save sends to server with**:
   ```json
   {
     ...formData,
     "isPartialSave": true,
     "skipCalculations": true,
     "currentStep": 1
   }
   ```
4. **Server processes**:
   - Filters out control flags
   - Saves form data to database
   - Skips heavy calculations
   - Returns success

## Testing Auto-Save

### In Browser DevTools Console:
1. Fill Step 1 of intake form
2. Open Console (F12)
3. Look for: `Auto-save successful at step 1`

### In Network Tab:
1. Filter by "financial-profile"
2. Look for PUT requests
3. Check Request Payload has `isPartialSave: true`
4. Check Response Status is 200

### To Verify Data Persists:
1. Fill some data in Step 1
2. Wait 5 seconds for auto-save
3. Refresh the page (F5)
4. Return to intake form
5. Your data should be there

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Data not loading on return
**Symptoms**: User fills data, it saves, but doesn't load when returning to form

**Possible Causes**:
1. Session expired
2. Profile exists but has null/empty fields
3. Data conversion issue in `convertServerDataToFormData`

**Debug Steps**:
1. Check Console for "Fetched financial profile:" log
2. Verify the data object has your saved values
3. Check if `reset(convertedData)` is being called

### Issue: Auto-save not triggering
**Symptoms**: No save requests in Network tab

**Possible Causes**:
1. Form not marked as dirty
2. `isLoading` or `isSubmitting` blocking saves
3. Debounce delay too long

**Solutions**:
1. Check `isDirty` state in React DevTools
2. Reduce debounce delay from 3000ms to 1000ms
3. Add more console logs to track save triggers

## Database Verification

To check if data is actually saved in database:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  user_id,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  date_of_birth,
  marital_status,
  state,
  created_at,
  updated_at
FROM financial_profiles
WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

## Summary

Auto-save is now working with:
- ✅ Partial saves every 3 seconds
- ✅ Skips heavy calculations during auto-save
- ✅ Preserves existing scores
- ✅ Logs success to console

The user reported that data wasn't loading when returning to the form. This needs further investigation but the auto-save mechanism itself is now properly implemented.
