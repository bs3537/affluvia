# Insurance Adequacy Score Methodology

## Overview
The Insurance Adequacy Score evaluates how well-protected you are against various life risks through insurance coverage. The score starts at 100 points and deducts points for missing or inadequate coverage based on your specific situation.

## Scoring Components

### 1. Life Insurance (Up to -45 points)
**Applicable to:** People with dependents or married individuals

- **No Coverage:** -30 points
- **Insufficient Coverage:** -15 points if coverage < 10x annual income
- **Recommended Coverage:** 10x annual household income

**Rationale:** Life insurance protects dependents from financial hardship if the primary earner passes away. The 10x income rule ensures dependents can maintain their lifestyle and meet long-term obligations.

### 2. Disability Insurance (-15 points)
**Applicable to:** Working individuals under age 60

- **No Coverage:** -15 points
- **Not Required:** Retired individuals or those 60+

**Rationale:** Disability insurance replaces income if you become unable to work due to illness or injury. It's crucial for working-age individuals as disability is more likely than death during working years.

### 3. Health Insurance (-20 points)
**Applicable to:** Everyone

- **No Coverage:** -20 points

**Rationale:** Health insurance protects against catastrophic medical expenses and ensures access to necessary healthcare. It's essential for financial security.

### 4. Homeowners/Property Insurance (-15 points)
**Applicable to:** Homeowners

- **No Coverage:** -15 points if you own a primary residence
- **Not Required:** Renters or those without property

**Rationale:** Property insurance protects your largest asset from damage, liability claims, and natural disasters.

### 5. Long-Term Care Insurance (-5 points)
**Applicable to:** Individuals over age 55

- **No Coverage:** -5 points
- **Not Required:** Those under 55

**Rationale:** LTC insurance covers extended care needs not covered by health insurance, protecting retirement assets from depletion due to care costs.

## Score Interpretation

- **80-100:** Excellent coverage - You're well-protected against major risks
- **60-79:** Good coverage - Consider addressing any gaps
- **40-59:** Moderate coverage - Several important coverage gaps exist
- **0-39:** Inadequate coverage - Significant risk exposure requiring immediate attention

## Key Considerations

1. **Life Stage Appropriate:** The scoring adjusts based on your life stage (age, employment status, dependents)
2. **Household Context:** For married individuals, considers combined household needs
3. **Risk-Based:** Prioritizes coverage based on likelihood and potential financial impact
4. **CFP Board Aligned:** Follows Certified Financial Planner Board guidelines for insurance planning

## Common Score Improvements

1. **Young Singles (No Dependents):**
   - Focus on health and disability insurance
   - Life insurance less critical without dependents

2. **Married with Children:**
   - Maximize life insurance coverage (10x income)
   - Ensure both spouses have adequate coverage

3. **Pre-Retirees (55+):**
   - Consider long-term care insurance
   - Maintain health coverage until Medicare eligible

4. **Retirees:**
   - Disability insurance no longer needed
   - Focus on health, property, and long-term care coverage
