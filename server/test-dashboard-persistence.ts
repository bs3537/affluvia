/**
 * Test Dashboard Widget Data Persistence
 * 
 * This test verifies that dashboard widgets use persisted data from the database
 * and only recalculate when necessary.
 * 
 * Expected Behavior:
 * 1. Intake form submission (PUT) → Calculates and persists all data to DB
 * 2. Dashboard load (GET) → Uses persisted data, no recalculation
 * 3. Navigation back to dashboard → Uses persisted data, no recalculation
 * 4. Login from new session → Uses persisted data, no recalculation
 */

// This is a documentation file to record expected behavior
// Actual testing should be done through the UI or API testing tools
