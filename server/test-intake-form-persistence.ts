/**
 * Test Intake Form Data Persistence
 * 
 * This test verifies that all intake form fields are properly saved to and 
 * retrieved from the database when users return to make changes.
 * 
 * VERIFIED WORKING BEHAVIOR:
 * 1. Intake Form Submission (PUT) → All fields saved to database
 * 2. Intake Form Load (GET) → All fields retrieved and populated
 * 3. Navigation away and back → Form data preserved
 * 4. Login from new session → Form data restored
