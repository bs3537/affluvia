## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Failed to create link token" | Check PLAID_CLIENT_ID and PLAID_SECRET in .env |
| "No accounts found" | Ensure you selected accounts during Plaid Link |
| Sync not working | Check webhook URL configuration |
| Balances not updating | Try manual sync or check rate limits |
| Can't connect account | Verify you're using sandbox credentials |

### Check Logs
```bash
# Backend logs
# Look for [PlaidService], [PlaidWebhook], [PlaidSyncScheduler] messages

# Check browser console for frontend errors
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features to Test

1. **Consent Management**
   - Grant consent before connecting accounts
   - Revoke consent removes all data

2. **Encryption**
   - All tokens encrypted at rest
   - Check database - no plain text tokens

3. **Audit Logging**
   - All operations logged
   - Check audit_logs table in database

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - 3 manual syncs per day
   - Test exceeding limit

## üìà Data Validation

### Expected Data from Sandbox

With `user_good` credentials, you should see:

- **Total Assets**: ~$320 (Checking + Savings)
- **Total Liabilities**: ~$410 (Credit Card)
- **Net Worth**: ~-$90
- **Transactions**: Last 2 years of test transactions
