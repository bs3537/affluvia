# Retirement Contribution Limits Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented 2025 IRS retirement contribution limits validation in the Affluvia financial planning app intake form. The implementation prevents users from entering contribution amounts that exceed legal limits and provides helpful warnings and guidance.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Contribution Limits Configuration (`/shared/retirement-contribution-limits.ts`)
- Complete 2025 IRS contribution limits for all retirement account types
- Age-based catch-up contribution calculations:
  - Standard catch-up (ages 50-59, 64+): $7,500
  - Enhanced catch-up (ages 60-63): $11,250
- Support for multiple account types:
  - 401(k), 403(b), 457(b): $23,500 base limit
  - Traditional/Roth IRA: $7,000 base limit
  - SIMPLE 401(k): $16,500 base limit
  - SEP IRA: $70,000 limit

### 2. Validation Hook (`/client/src/hooks/use-retirement-contribution-validation.tsx`)
- Real-time validation of monthly contribution amounts
- Automatic calculation of annual contributions
- Warning messages when approaching limits (90% threshold)
- Error messages when exceeding limits
- Helpful information about catch-up eligibility
- Visual components for displaying validation messages

### 3. Intake Form Integration
- Added validation to retirement contribution fields (Step 11)
- Displays real-time contribution limit information based on user's age
- Separate validation for user and spouse contributions
- Shows warnings for individual retirement accounts (401k, 403b, IRA) in assets section
- Form submission validation to prevent saving invalid data

### 4. Key Validation Rules
- Employee contributions cannot exceed annual limits
- Total contributions (employee + employer) cannot exceed total annual additions limit
- Combined contributions to similar account types (e.g., 401k + 403b) share the same limit
- Age-based catch-up contributions automatically calculated from date of birth

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- **Blue info boxes**: Display current contribution limits based on age
- **Yellow warning boxes**: Alert when approaching limits (90%+)
- **Red error boxes**: Show when limits are exceeded
- **Helpful messages**: Include specific dollar amounts and eligibility information

### Example Messages
- "2025 employee contribution limit: $31,000/year ($2,583/month)"
- "✨ Enhanced catch-up eligible (age 61): includes $11,250 catch-up"
- "You're approaching the contribution limit. You have $3,500 remaining for 2025."
- "Your annual contribution of $30,000 exceeds the 2025 limit of $23,500 by $6,500."

## Testing

### Test Files Created
1. **Unit Tests**: `/shared/__tests__/retirement-contribution-limits.test.ts`
   - Tests for all age groups and account types
   - Validation logic verification
   - Combined contribution limit checks

2. **Manual Test Script**: `/server/test-contribution-limits.ts`
   - Comprehensive testing of all features
   - Example scenarios for different ages
   - Validation examples with clear output

### Test Results

✅ Age-based catch-up calculations accurate
✅ Contribution limits properly enforced

   - Added spouse contribution fields with validation
   - Added submission validation

### Files Created

4. `/server/test-contribution-limits.ts` - Manual test script

## Usage

### For Users
1. Enter monthly retirement contributions in Step 11 of intake form
2. View real-time validation messages
3. See contribution limits based on your age
4. Get warnings before exceeding limits
5. Cannot submit form if contributions exceed IRS limits

### For Developers
```typescript
// Import validation functions
import { validateContribution, getContributionLimit } from '@shared/retirement-contribution-limits';

// Check contribution limit for user
const limit = getContributionLimit('401k', birthDate);

// Validate a contribution amount
const validation = validateContribution(monthlyAmount, '401k', birthDate, false);
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.error(validation.message);
}
```

## Compliance

2. Include Roth IRA income limits
3. Add employer match optimization suggestions
4. Historical contribution tracking
5. Mid-year limit change handling
