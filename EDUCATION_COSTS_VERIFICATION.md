# Education Funding Center - College Costs Verification

## Verification Summary

### ✅ College Costs from API are Properly Included in All Calculations:

1. **Backend Calculation (routes.ts)**
   - Line 1654-1656: Correctly uses `goal.costPerYear` when `costOption` is 'custom' or 'specific'
   - When a college is selected from dropdown, costOption is set to 'specific' and costPerYear contains the actual college cost

2. **Cost Breakdown Display (education-funding-center.tsx)**
   - Lines 619-664: Shows accurate breakdown with:
     - Annual Cost from selected college
     - College name display
     - Scholarships/Grants deduction
     - Net cost after aid

3. **What-If Scenario Planner (education-scenario-planner.tsx)**
   - Line 168: Uses `goal.costPerYear` for calculations
   - Correctly calculates funding status based on actual college costs

4. **Monte Carlo Analysis (monte-carlo.ts)**
   - Fixed line 140: Now checks for both 'custom' and 'specific' cost options
   - Ensures college-specific costs are used in probability calculations

### ✅ Education Plan Modal Size:

1. **Modal Container (education-funding-center.tsx)**
   - Line 587: Set to `max-w-7xl` (very large width)
   - Line 583: Has `overflow-y-auto` for scrolling
   - Line 589: Content has `max-h-[calc(100vh-100px)]` to prevent overflow

### Key Features Working Correctly:

1. **College Search Integration**
   - API endpoint at `/api/education/college-search` fetches from College Scorecard
   - Returns in-state tuition, out-of-state tuition, and room & board costs
   - Costs are properly stored in `goal.costPerYear`

2. **Cost Flow Through System**
   - College selection → goal.costPerYear → backend calculations → frontend display
   - All charts, projections, and analyses use the actual selected college costs

3. **User Experience**
   - Large modal with scrolling for comfortable viewing
   - Clear cost breakdown showing college name and actual costs
   - What-If planner allows adjusting costs to see impact

## Testing Recommendations:

1. Add a new education goal and select a specific college
2. Verify the annual cost matches the college's tuition + room/board
3. Check that the funding calculations reflect the actual cost
4. Use What-If planner to see cost adjustments work correctly
5. Ensure Monte Carlo analysis shows accurate success probability
