## ðŸ”„ AUTOMATIC UNDO/REVERT SYSTEM (MANDATORY)

### CRITICAL: Checkpoint Before Code Changes
**You MUST create a checkpoint before ANY code modifications:**
```bash
git checkpoint "About to [describe what you're doing]"
```

### User Undo Commands
When users type any of these in the message box, immediately execute the undo:
- "undo" â†’ Run: `git undo-last`
- "revert" â†’ Run: `git undo-last`
- "rollback" â†’ Run: `git undo` (shows checkpoint selection)
- "undo changes" â†’ Run: `git undo-last`

### Available Undo Commands
- `git undo-last` - Instantly revert to last checkpoint (no questions asked)
- `git undo` - Interactive rollback with checkpoint list
- `./claude-undo.sh undo` - Alternative undo with nice formatting
- `./claude-undo.sh undo list` - View all checkpoints
- `./claude-undo.sh undo [number]` - Revert to specific checkpoint

### Checkpoint Best Practices
1. Create checkpoint BEFORE starting code edits
2. Use descriptive messages: `git checkpoint "Adding API endpoint for user settings"`
3. Multiple checkpoints for complex tasks
4. Always checkpoint before risky operations (deletions, major refactors)

### Example Workflow
```bash
# Before making changes
git checkpoint "Implementing new UI component"
# ... make code changes ...
# If user wants to undo
git undo-last  # Instantly back to checkpoint
```

Use Context7 MCP server at starting Claude CLI.

MCP Servers to connect at startup:
- **Context7**: For retrieving up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library

## Tool Usage Priority
1. **For documentation**: Use Context7
2. **For codebase operations**: Use built-in Claude tools
3. **Fallback**: Standard toolset as needed

## Code Editing Method (MANDATORY - UPDATED 2025-08-15)
**Code editing priority order for ALL code edits:**

### PRIORITY 1 - PRIMARY METHOD (USE FIRST):
- **`ast-grep CLI tool`**: Preferred AST-based code editing tool for precise structural modifications
  - Use for all function, class, and method modifications
  - Provides reliable AST-based editing with proper syntax preservation

### PRIORITY 2 - SECONDARY METHODS (USE IF AST-GREP UNAVAILABLE):
- **Claude's built-in Edit/MultiEdit tools**: Fallback for code editing


Use Claude Opus 4.1 with extended thinkng model for planning and Claude Sonnet 4 with extended thinking model for making code edits. 

Think step by step.

## Development Guidelines

You are an expert coder and programmer.

Always scan the entire app codebase when you receive any instruction. Understand the user's question, make a plan to solve it and then break it down to smaller steps in your order of preference.

### Enhanced Search Capabilities
- Use the enhanced search tools located in the project root:
  - `./search-helper.sh` - Command-line search tool with multiple search modes
  - `./enhanced-codebase-search.ts` - TypeScript search API
- When searching the codebase, use parallel search patterns for better performance
- Include context lines (-C flag) when using grep/ripgrep for better understanding
- Search across appropriate file types (.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx, .sql)

### Important Instruction Reminders
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Maintain consistency with the existing architecture
