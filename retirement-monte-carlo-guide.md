# Guide to Implementing Monte Carlo Simulations for Retirement Success Probability

Monte Carlo simulations estimate the probability that a retiree's portfolio will sustain their desired spending throughout retirement by running thousands of randomized scenarios based on historical or projected data. Success probability is the percentage of simulations where the portfolio balance remains positive until the end of the planning horizon (e.g., life expectancy). Target thresholds typically range from 70% to 90% for conservative plans, assuming willingness to adjust spending if needed.

## User Intake Form Variables

Collect comprehensive data via an intake form to personalize simulations. Categorize into demographics, finances, and preferences. Require validation for completeness and reasonableness (e.g., flag if expected returns exceed historical averages).

| Category | Key Variables | Rationale | Example Input Format |
|----------|---------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Demographics** | Current age, spouse's age (if applicable), planned retirement age, life expectancy (or use actuarial tables, e.g., to age 95 for conservatism). | Determines simulation horizon and withdrawal timeline. | Numeric fields; dropdown for gender/health adjustments to life expectancy. |
| **Income & Expenses** | Current annual income, expected retirement expenses (base + discretionary), inflation-adjusted spending goals, sources of guaranteed income (e.g., Social Security, pensions, annuities). | Calculates net withdrawal needs; expenses often modeled as 70-80% of pre-retirement income. | Currency fields; sliders for expense categories (e.g., healthcare at 15% of total). |
| **Assets & Liabilities** | Current savings/investment balances (taxable, tax-deferred like 401(k), Roth), asset allocation (stocks/bonds/cash percentages), ongoing contributions, debts (e.g., mortgage). | Forms the portfolio baseline; allocation affects return volatility. | Account breakdowns; pie chart selector for allocation. |
| **Risk & Preferences** | Risk tolerance (conservative/moderate/aggressive), tax bracket, healthcare/long-term care needs, legacy goals (e.g., desired inheritance). | Influences return assumptions and adjustments; e.g., high risk tolerance allows higher equity allocation. | Likert scale for tolerance; checkboxes for insurance coverage. |
| **Other** | Expected inflation rate (user override possible), tax rates on withdrawals, sequence of returns risk preferences. | Accounts for real-world erosion of purchasing power and taxes. | Percentage fields; optional advanced overrides. |

**Best Practice:** Aim for 20-30 fields total to avoid user fatigue; use progressive disclosure (e.g., show spouse fields only if married).

## Other Inputs for Calculations

Beyond user data, incorporate external assumptions to model uncertainty. Source from historical data (e.g., S&P 500 returns 1926-2024 averaging ~10% nominal) or forward-looking estimates (e.g., from Vanguard or BlackRock). Update annually for recency.

### Market Assumptions
- **Expected returns**: 
  - Stocks: 6-8% real
  - Bonds: 1-3% real
- **Standard deviations**: 
  - Stocks: 15-20%
  - Bonds: 5-7%
- **Correlations**: Stock-bond: -0.2 to 0.2
- Use lognormal distributions for realism

### Economic Factors
- **Inflation**: 2-3% mean, SD 1-2%
- **Interest rates**: e.g., Vasicek model for stochastic paths
- **Longevity variability**: e.g., Poisson distribution for mortality

### Taxes & Fees
- **Marginal tax rates**: federal/state
- **Investment fees**: 0.5-1%
- **Withdrawal strategies**: e.g., Roth conversions

### Stochastic Elements
- **Random shocks**: Market crashes with fat-tail distributions like Student's t
- **Healthcare costs**: Gamma distribution for outliers

### Simulation Parameters
- **Number of runs**: 1,000-10,000 for stability
- **Horizon**: User life expectancy + buffer
- **Failure definition**: Balance < $0 before horizon end

## Variables to Include in Calculations

Integrate all inputs into a holistic model. Core equation for portfolio evolution in each simulation year t:

**P_{t+1} = P_t × (1 + r_t) - W_t × (1 + i_t) + C_t - T_t - F_t**

Where:
- **P_t**: Portfolio balance at time t
- **r_t**: Stochastic return (drawn from distribution based on allocation)
- **W_t**: Withdrawal (e.g., 4% initial, inflation-adjusted)
- **i_t**: Inflation rate (stochastic)
- **C_t**: Contributions (if pre-retirement)
- **T_t**: Taxes on withdrawals/returns
- **F_t**: Fees

### Additional Variables
- **Asset Returns**: Multi-asset correlations via Cholesky decomposition for multivariate normal draws
- **Sequence Risk**: Model poor early returns amplifying failure
- **Longevity**: Vary end age per simulation (e.g., normal distribution around mean expectancy)
- **Healthcare/LTC**: Add lump-sum shocks (e.g., $100k+ events with 20% probability post-80)
- **Taxes**: Bracket-based calculations; simulate Roth vs. traditional impacts
- **Adjustments**: Dynamic rules (e.g., reduce spending by 10% if probability falls below 70%)

## Algorithms to Use

Implement in Python (e.g., via NumPy/Pandas) or integrated software. Core algorithm: Monte Carlo with bootstrapping or parametric distributions.

### 1. Initialization
- Load user data and assumptions
- Define distributions: e.g., returns ~ lognormal(μ, σ), inflation ~ normal(2.5%, 1.5%)

### 2. Simulation Loop (for N=5000 runs)
- Generate random paths: For each year, draw returns, inflation, etc.
- Evolve portfolio: Apply the equation above annually until horizon
- Check success: If P_t > 0 for all t up to longevity, count as success
- Handle correlations: Use covariance matrix for joint draws

### 3. Output Calculation
- **Success probability**: (Successful runs / N) × 100
- **Metrics**: Median ending balance, 10th/90th percentiles, safe withdrawal rate (SWR) via solver (e.g., binary search for SWR yielding 80% success)

### 4. Advanced Techniques
- **Regime-Based**: Segment into bull/bear markets (e.g., low CAPE implies higher future returns)
- **Fat Tails**: Use t-distribution or historical bootstrapping to capture crashes
- **Guardrails**: Adjust withdrawals dynamically (e.g., if probability <50%, cut 20%)
- **Solvers**: Optimize variables (e.g., retirement age for 85% success) via gradient descent or grid search
- **Validation**: Backtest against historical periods (e.g., 1929-1959) for calibration

### Sample Python Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def monte_carlo_retirement(params, N=5000):
    successes = 0
    endings = []
    for _ in range(N):
        portfolio = params['initial_balance']
        for t in range(params['horizon']):
            ret = np.random.lognormal(params['mu'], params['sigma'])  # Stochastic return
            inf = np.random.normal(0.025, 0.015)  # Inflation
            withdraw = params['initial_withdraw'] * (1 + inf)**t
            portfolio = portfolio * (1 + ret) - withdraw
            if portfolio <= 0:
                break
        if portfolio > 0:
            successes += 1
        endings.append(portfolio)
    prob_success = (successes / N) * 100
    return prob_success, np.percentile(endings, [10, 50, 90])
```

## Best Practices and Visualizations

### Success Thresholds
- Aim for 75-90% success
- Below 70% signals high risk

### Sensitivity Analysis
- Vary one input (e.g., returns ±2%) and plot impacts

### Recommended Visualizations
- **Histograms**: For ending balances
- **Fan charts**: For portfolio paths (10th-90th percentiles)
- **Heatmaps**: For success by age/allocation

### Example Results Table

| Allocation | Success Probability (%) | Median Ending Balance ($M) |
|------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| 60/40 Stocks/Bonds | 85 | 1.2 |
| 80/20 | 78 | 1.5 |
| 40/60 | 92 | 0.8 |

### Implementation Tips
- Incorporate user feedback loops: Rerun simulations with adjustments (e.g., delay retirement) to show trade-offs
- Test for biases (e.g., over-optimism in returns) via historical validation
- Use progressive disclosure in UI to avoid overwhelming users
- Provide clear explanations of what success probability means in practical terms
